### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Suliyat 

## An experienced business intelligence/data analyst

I am an analyst who is always looking for challenging opportunities where I can leverage my over three years of extensive experience in business intelligence and data analytics to provide actionable insight from raw data.

Over the years in my professional journey, I have accumulated extensive experience and technical expertise as an Analyst, working with diverse datasets across different sectors. As an Analyst at a leading technology company that consults for clients across the world, I have also excelled in solving problems with technical tools like SQL, Python, Azure, Power BI and Excel.  My proficiency in these tools has equipped me to extract actionable insights and drive informed decision-making processes.

- âš¡ Fun fact: What comes to mind when you hear the word "unicorn,"? 
Did you just picture a mythical creature or a rare find in the woods?  Or Did a company with growth that's off the charts and innovation that turns heads come to your mind?
Well I see something even more magical thatâ€™s why  you can also call me a *"Data Unicorn"* â€“ someone who sprinkles code with a touch of enchantment and turns data into gold
